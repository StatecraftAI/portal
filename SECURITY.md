# Security Hardening Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented for the StatecraftAI website.

## Security Headers

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

- Restricts resource loading to same origin
- Prevents XSS attacks by controlling script execution
- Blocks inline scripts except where explicitly allowed

### X-Frame-Options

- Set to `DENY` to prevent clickjacking attacks
- Prevents the site from being embedded in iframes

### X-Content-Type-Options

- Set to `nosniff` to prevent MIME type sniffing
- Reduces risk of drive-by downloads

### X-XSS-Protection

- Enables browser's built-in XSS protection
- Set to block mode for maximum security

### Referrer Policy

- Set to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- Limits referrer information leakage

### Permissions Policy

- Disables unnecessary browser features
- Prevents access to geolocation, camera, microphone, etc.

## Input Validation & Sanitization

### Email Validation

- Comprehensive regex validation
- Length limits (max 254 characters)
- Real-time validation feedback
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS

### Rate Limiting

- 5-second cooldown between form submissions
- Client-side rate limiting with potential server-side enforcement
- Bot detection through user interaction tracking

## Code Organization

### Separation of Concerns

- CSS moved to external file (`css/styles.css`)
- JavaScript split into logical modules:
  - `js/security.js` - Security measures
  - `js/animation.js` - Background animation
  - `js/form.js` - Form handling and validation

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
- Try-catch blocks around critical functions
- Console warnings for developers

## Accessibility & SEO

### Accessibility

- ARIA labels and roles
- Screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation
- Focus management
- Skip links for navigation

### SEO Optimization

- Structured data (JSON-LD)
- Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags
- Semantic HTML structure
- Optimized meta descriptions
- Sitemap.xml and robots.txt

## Performance Optimizations

### Resource Loading

- Preloading of critical resources
- Deferred JavaScript loading
- Image optimization with proper alt text
- DNS prefetching for external resources

### Caching

- Browser caching headers via .htaccess
- Compression enabled for text resources
- Long-term caching for static assets

## Server-Side Security (.htaccess)

### File Protection

- Blocks access to sensitive files (.htaccess, .git, logs)
- Prevents access to hidden files
- Custom error pages

### Performance & Security

- Compression enabled
- Hotlinking prevention
- Basic rate limiting (if mod_evasive is available)
- Server signature hiding

## Browser Compatibility

### Feature Detection

- Canvas support detection
- localStorage availability check
- Event listener support verification
- Graceful fallbacks for unsupported features

### Progressive Enhancement

- Core functionality works without JavaScript
- Enhanced experience with JavaScript enabled
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Monitoring & Logging

### Client-Side

- Error logging to console
- Performance monitoring via visibility API
- User interaction tracking for bot detection

### Recommendations for Production

1. Enable HTTPS and add HSTS headers
2. Implement server-side rate limiting
3. Add monitoring and alerting
4. Regular security audits
5. Keep dependencies updated
6. Implement proper logging and monitoring
